Hi, my name is Ivan Morrow. I'm a software engineer and I'm passionate about learning and exploring new technologies. I studied Computer Science and Physics at Coe College where I also played basketball for 4 years. During my time there, I participated in Machine Learning research and published a paper on it, available [here](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-0221/14/06/P06013).

Since finishing undergrad in 2020, I have been working at an Options Market Making Firm in Chicago called Belvedere Trading. I've had a few different roles here, but currently as a Cloud Platform Engineer. Outside of work I spend a lot of time on ML/AI related topics. It's my number one area of interest at the moment. 

Right now, I am really focused on CUDA, High-Performance Computing, Mojo, PyTorch, and MLOps.

I am currently enrolled in the Graduate Computer Systems Engineering Certification program at Colorado State University. I plan to enroll in the full Computer Engineering Master's program once the certificate is completed.

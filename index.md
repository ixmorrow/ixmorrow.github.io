        <h1 class="hero-title">Hi, I'm Ivan Morrow</h1>
        <p class="hero-subtitle">Software Engineer & ML/AI Enthusiast</p>
        
        <p>I'm passionate about learning and exploring new technologies. I studied Computer Science and Physics at Coe College where I also played basketball for 4 years. During my time there, I participated in Machine Learning research and published a <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-0221/14/06/P06013" target="_blank">research paper</a>.</p>
        
        <p>Since finishing undergrad in 2020, I've been working at Belvedere Trading in Chicago, currently as a Cloud Platform Engineer. Outside of work, I spend a lot of time on ML/AI related topics—it's my number one area of interest.</p>
